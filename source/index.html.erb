<p>Art is more than just a form of expression &mdash; it is a glimpse into the past. Through studying artwork of previous generations, we are able to gain important knowledge regarding the history and culture of different civilizations. However, without the science of chemistry, art would lose all of its significance. Artwork is not indestructible; materials used to create art are susceptible to damage. Humidity, acid rain, and erosion are just a few of the possible factors that affect art. Without proper preservation techniques, the environment artwork is stored in can alter its composition or damage its proper state, causing important elements and details to be lost. Oil paintings, indoor art such as marble statues and ancient pottery, and outdoor art found in architecture and monuments all require different preservation techniques. Luckily, thanks to developments in modern day science, processes exist that not only preserve art, but also help to restore pieces back to close to their original appearance. Without chemistry, valuable works of art would be lost forever &mdash; with the capability to protect art against destructive elements, we are able to restore the past and preserve a bright future for the harmony of science and art.</p>
