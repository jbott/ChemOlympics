<h1>Paintings</h1>

<p>There are many different reasons why paintings and other artwork can deteriorate and need restoration. Pollution, tourists, smog and even candle smoke can have a negative impact on indoor works of art like paintings. A main factor that has detrimental effects on older artwork is humidity. This issue is evident in artwork such as Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper: water molecules have warped and distorted the paint, altering this famous painting's appearance <%= link_to "(6)", "#6" %>.</p>

<p>Like most 15th century oil paintings, The Last Supper was painted on a canvas with an open back. Additionally, a base coat called gesso was initially applied to ensure adherence of the oil paint to the canvas. Due to exposure to high levels of humidity, the bonds between the gesso and the oil paint have broken, subsequently causing the paint on da Vinci’s iconic painting to flake off <%= link_to "(4)", "#4" %>. In addition to creating bond breakage, humidity has also caused the fabric of the canvas of The Last Supper to expand and contract. This persistent expansion and contraction has created cracks in the surface of the canvas due to the brittle nature of aged oil paint <%= link_to "(5)", "#5" %>. Many paintings created with oil paints on canvas have suffered similar fates due to the destructive effects of humidity.</p>


<p>When a painting becomes cracked and water distorts the paint, key features are lost; restoration is a necessity in order for the work of art be brought back to as close to its original state as possible. Pinin Brambilla Barcilon recently used restoration methods to improve the appearance of The Last Supper. Barcilon utilized sonar and radar to obtain information on the elastic properties of the paintings. Small TV cameras were placed in boreholes of the canvas to help provide more details about the cracks in the painting. With the help of infrared, laser and camera technology, Barcilon was able to see the complete composition of the painting. She then used solvents with specialized enzymes to remove certain pollutants that had built up on the surface of the painting. For example when removing grease, a solvent with lipids such as lipase was used. This process allowed for actuate precision at a micron level <%= link_to "(6)", "#6" %>. Although the process took a lot of time due to the fact that small sections were cleaned individually, in the end it paid off. The Last Supper was successfully restored to a condition extremely close to its original state <%= link_to "(6)", "#6" %>.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, when water gets in between the canvas and paint in oil paintings, water molecules pull apart the pigments, warping the paint <%= link_to "(3)", "#3" %>. To avoid this, removing as much water as possible from the atmosphere a painting is exposed to is of the utmost importance; thus a dehydrating agent is needed. Many museums use a substance known as Silica gel, or the network solid form of SiO<sub>2</sub>. In the network solid, the silicon and the oxygen covalently bond together, locking the atoms into a strongly bonded crystal. This means that atoms that are bonded with another are locked in extremely tightly. Atoms that aren’t bonded on all sides, like the O<sup>2-</sup>’s on the outside, are extremely reactive. Due to the high reactivity, the O<sup>2-</sup>’s will gain a hydrogen, forming a silanol group (Si-O-H) <%= link_to "(1)", "#1" %>. The silanol groups can form hydrogen bonds with the gaseous water molecules in the air, effectively attracting and bonding to a majority of the water. Because only the outsides of the substance contain silanol groups, silica only adorbs water in the air <%= link_to "(2)", "#2" %>. Using silica gel has been shown to be a proven preservation technique. Works encased with silica gel, such as Georgia O’Keefe’s Black Hollyhock, Blue Larkspur, have survived for decades without any damage due to humidity <%= link_to "(3)", "#3" %>.</p>
